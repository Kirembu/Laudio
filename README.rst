l-audio is a webbased player which takes advantage of the HTML5 audio element to 
play its music. Its aim is to provide a better interface than its competitor
Ampache.

l-audio is based on the Python Framework Django and uses Apache as server.
Installed on the machine where your music collection resides, it can be accessed
in the whole network. By forwarding Port 80 on your router,
even your friends can listen to it over the Internet.

Installing 
==========

Git
---
To get the unstable trunk fire up your console and change to the path where you
want the source to be downloaded. Then type in::

    $ git clone git@github.com:Raydiation/Laudio.git
    $ cd Laudio*
    $ sudo /bin/bash setup.sh

To get fonts working on debian based system you need to replace the symlinks to the fonts::

    $ sudo rm /usr/share/laudio/laudio/static/upload/themes/default/fonts/*
    $ ln -s /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf /usr/share/laudio/laudio/static/upload/themes/default/font/DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf
    $ ln -s /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSansCondensed.ttf /usr/share/laudio/laudio/static/upload/themes/default/font/DejaVuSansCondensed.ttf

Developement
============
Grep the source from github and run the install script::

    $ git clone git@github.com:Raydiation/Laudio.git
    $ cd Laudio*
    $ sudo /bin/bash setup.sh

Check the branches with git::

    $ git branch
    
Change to the branche you want to develop in::

    $ git checkout $BRANCH
    
Then run the developement server::

    $ python laudio/manage.py runserver

l-audio is now available at http://localhost:8000/

Translation
===========
To translate l-audio into your language, you must do the following. First
get your language code on http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Language-Codes
This code will be referenced as $LGCODE in this documentation. Then go
into the main directory and run::

    $ django-admin.py makemessages -l $LGCODE -e js
    
To update the language files to the current status, run::

    $ django-admin.py makemessages -a

If you made all your changes, you need to compile the translation into a
format which can be read by gettext. To do this, simply run::

    $ django-admin.py compilemessages
    
If you've added a new language, you must change the LANGUAGE dictionairy
in the settings.py file by adding the corresponding language.

Finally update the setup.py in the top directory to include your directory.

Working on an existing translation
----------------------------------
Update the translations by running::

    $ django-admin.py makemessages -a

Then make your changes to the translation file in locale/$LGCODE/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
and compile the messages with this command when you're done::

    $ django-admin.py compilemessages

Example for adding polish language translation
----------------------------------------------
Go into the main directory and run::

    $ django-admin.py makemessages -l pl -e js
    $ django-admin.py makemessages -a
    
Edit the file in locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES/django.po then compile your messages::

    $ django-admin.py compilemessages


Now activate the translation in the settings.py. To do this change this::

    LANGUAGES = (
        ('de', _('German')),
        ('en', _('English')),
    )

to this::

    LANGUAGES = (
          ('de', _('German')),
          ('en', _('English')),
          ('pl', _('Polish')),
    )
    
Then update the setup.py and by adding this to package_data::

    'laudio/locale/pl/*',
        'laudio/locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES/*',

How to create and deploy your own Themes
========================================
A sample theme is available in::

    laudio/static/upload/themes/default

To start a new one simply copy the theme and make changes to it.

The theme must have the following layout, but you may have additional files and 
folders in the $theme_name folder::

    $theme_name/
    $theme_name/main.css
    $theme_name/player.css
    $theme_name/settings.css
    $theme_name/setup.css

$theme_name is your own theme name. The theme name must not be 'default', also
it must not contain any other characters than English characters, numbers and underscores (regex [a-zA-Z0-9_]).
If the themename does not follow these rules, the upload will fail!

If you've made your changes, simply create a tar.gz or a tar.bz2.
The tar file must have the themefolder in its top directory!
These archives can be uploaded on the settings page, but you may also just move your 
$theme_name folder into the laudio/static/upload/themes/default directory.

$theme_name/main.css
--------------------
Is loaded on every page

$theme_name/player.css
----------------------
Only loaded on the player page

$theme_name/settings.css
------------------------
Loaded on the login page, the profile page and the settings page

$theme_name/setup.css
---------------------
Only loaded on the setup page


Security
========
To only allow access from apache to your music directory please change the 
/etc/laudio/apache/laudio.conf::
    
    <Directory />

to::
    
    <Directory /your/music/directory/>

Versioning
==========
l-audio uses even stable odd unstable versioning, e.g. 0.4 would be stable whereas 
0.5 would be unstable.

The numbers are given in the following way::

    MAIN_VERSION.NEW_FEATURE.BUGFIX

so 0.5.3.2 would be the unstable release 0.5, with the 3rd release of a minor 
feature and the second bugfix release.

FAQ
===
Are keyboard shortcuts available?
---------------------------------
Yes the following keyboard shortcuts are supported:

* [alt] + [n]: next song

* [alt] + [b]: previous song

* [alt] + [p]: play/pause

* [alt] + [s]: shuffle on/off

* [alt] + [r]: repeat on/off

* [alt] + [m]: mute on/off

* [alt] + [j]: jump to currently playing song

* [alt] + [w]: toggle sidebar

* [alt] + [q]: toggle playlist

* [alt] + [e]: toggle browser

* [alt] + [u]: userprofile

* [alt] + [x]: settings

* [alt] + [l]: login/logout

* [alt] + [i]: index page

``Important``: Browsers implement this differently. In the case of Firefox you have
to press [shift] + [alt] instead of [alt], Opera uses [shift] + [esc] instead of [alt]

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_key#Access_in_different_browsers for more infos

How can i use l-audio with lighttpd?
------------------------------------
TBD

How can i use l-audio with mysql?
---------------------------------
First of all, you need python-mysql, depending on your distro the package can
be named ``python-mysql`` or ``mysql-python``. Then you have to change the 
/usr/share/laudio/laudio/settings.py from::

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', # Add 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
            'NAME': LAUDIO_SQLITE_PATH,    # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
            #'USER': '',                      # Not used with sqlite3.
            #'PASSWORD': '',                  # Not used with sqlite3.
            #'HOST': '',                      # Set to empty string for localhost. Not used with sqlite3.
            #'PORT': '',                      # Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3.  
        }
    }

to::

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql', # Add 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
            'NAME': 'mysql_database',    # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
            'USER': 'mysql_user',                      # Not used with sqlite3.
            'PASSWORD': 'mysql_password',                  # Not used with sqlite3.
            'HOST': 'mysql_host',                      # Set to empty string for localhost. Not used with sqlite3.
            'PORT': 'mysql_port',                      # Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3.  
        }
    }
    
Then you have to recreate the database::

    python /usr/share/laudio/laudio/manage.py syncdb --noinput
    
And restart your webserver::

    /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

The same procedure basically applies to other databases like oracle and postgresql.

Which Browsers does l-audio support?
-----------------------------------
Depends wether you want to use MP3 or OGG VORBIS

``MP3``: All, Flash required

``OGG``: Google Chrome, Chromium, Opera, Firefox


What filerights should my musicdirectory have?
----------------------------------------------
The music files should be chmoded 0755. Every folder above the files has
to have a+x, so Apache can traverse down into the directory


How can i change the URL under which l-audio is being run
--------------------------------------------------------
If you want to let l-audio run under a different URL then localhost/laudio, like
localhost/audio for instance, you can now easily adjust it.

Open the /etc/laudio/apache/laudio.conf and change the two lines to::

    Alias /audio/static/ /usr/share/laudio/laudio/static/
    WSGIScriptAlias /audio /usr/share/laudio/laudio/static/django.wsgi

Finally restart your Apache webserver::

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
