    <h1>About Laudio</h1>
    <p>Laudio, whose name orignites from LAN Audio, is a webclient for your Musiccollection. It
    aims to replace the currently mostly broken DAAP players, which can stream DAAP shares over
    the local network. Thanks to Apple, who break/encrypt their services after external programs
    start using it, DAAP is partly broken ever since including iTunes 7.</p>
    <p>Future Releases also plan some filesharing service for you and your friends 
    (only legal tracks should be shared -> jamendo.com) and an access control to your collection.
    Maybe we'll support ampache xml interfaces too if it isnt too hard ;)</p>
    
    <h3>Recommended webbrowser are: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Chrome/Chromium v. 4+ - If you dont like Google, just use it locally, defenitely the fastest and best choice though</li>
        <li>Firefox 3.5+ - A bit slow due to some bugs with large table which we are using heavily</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Less recommended webbrowser are: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Konqueror 4.4+ - Well, I didnt test it but it should run quite well. You'll need the codecs from your gstreamer/xine backend though</li>
        <li>Epiphany 2.30+ - Supporting audio/video but "support is not perfect"</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Not recommended are the following ones due to these issues:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer any version - Slow and no HTML 5, you really dont want this one</li>
        <li>Apple Safari - Were replacing an Apple product, so yes, Safari is of course the only browser who doesnt support ogg in its HTML5 audio/video tags</li>
    </ul>    
    <h3>Known Issues</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Slow when having huge (10k+ songs) collections</li>
        <li>Slow in Firefox when displaying a lot of songs: this is a Firefox bug occuring with large tables</li>
        <li>Lacking mp3 support (think of it as feature, not a bug)</li>
    </ul>
