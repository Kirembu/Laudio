    <h1>About Laudio</h1>
    <p>Laudio is a webclient and server for your Musiccollection. It aims
    to replace the DAAP standard which originates from Apple.
    After some years, Apple decided to encrypt iTunes' DAAP service making
    it nearly impossible to set up shares or listen to shares.</p>
    
    <p>Other than Ampache, Laudio implements an easy to use interface and
    uses some of the web's newest features such as the HTML5 audio and 
    tag canvas. This requires the users to have a recent browser which 
    supports HTML5.</p>
    
    <p>Laudio supports MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, both implemented using HTML5.
    That means if you want to listen to MP3, you need a browser which is 
    able to play MP3, such as Chromium. Firefox only supports Ogg Vorbis.</p>
    
    <h2>Recommended Browser </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Firefox 3.5 or higher</li>
        <li>Chrome 4 or higher</li>
        <li>Chromium 5 or higher</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Less recommended webbrowser</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Epiphany: extremely slow</li>
        <li>Apple Safari - Safari only plays MP3</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Not recommended browsers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer any version - Doesnt support HTML5 yet</li>
    </ul>
