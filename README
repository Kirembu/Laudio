LAUDIO is a webbased audio player written in python and javascript.
Dont expect it to be perfect, im not so sure about the file rights and the chmod commands,
help would be appreciated.

I basically wrote it as a replacement for DAAP which is currently really broken.

I tested this things on my Gentoo stable machine with Django 1.1.1 and Firefox 3.5
CHROMIUM IS CURRENTLY BROKEN CONCERNING THE <audio> TAG!

TODO:
* Add Playlist features: save, open, rename, delete
* Support drag and drop for the playlist
* Develop a webserver for IP Registration and friends management where you can
  set who can access your music
* Add a friends search where you can search music from your friends shares
* Design improvements (logo)
* Get Chromium to work
* Add ampache api

Dependencies:

[UBUNTU]
sudo apt-get install python-lxml python-django python-mutagen apache2 sqlite3 libapache2-mod-wsgi python-pysqlite
[GENTOO]
emerge -av dev-python/django dev-python/lxml media-libs/mutagen dev-python/pysqlite dev-db/sqlite www-apache/mod_wsgi www-servers/apache
[ARCH LINUX]
sudo pacman -S extra/django extra/python-lxml extra/mutagen extra/apache
extra/python-pysqlite core/sqlite3 extra/mod_wsgi

To get it running extract the tarball to /opt/ and ensure that the folder is
named "laudio", then run the following commands:
sudo chmod -R 0755 /opt/laudio
sudo chmod 0777 /opt/laudio/static

Now put laudio.conf into
[GENTOO]
/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/
[UBUNTU]
/etc/apache2/conf.d/
[ARCH LINUX]
/etc/httpd/conf/extra/

Arch Linux users have to explicitely include the file in their httpd.conf
sudo echo "Include conf/extra/laudio.conf" >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf


and finally restart the server:
[GENTOO][UBUNTU]
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
[ARCH LINUX]
sudo /etc/rc.d/httpd restart


For Arch Linux and Gentoo you have to add apache to the system startup
[GENTOO]
rc-update add apache2 default
[ARCH LINUX]
add httpd to your DAEMONS=() in /etc/rc.conf

Laudio should be accessible in your Browser under http://localhost/laudio

you'll need the following filerights for your musiccollection:
* every folder above your collection has to be chmodded 0711
* the actualy musicfolder has to be chmodded 0755
