LAUDIO is a webbased audio player written in python and javascript.
Dont expect it to be perfect, im not so sure about the file rights and the chmod commands,
help would be appreciated.

I basically wrote it as a replacement for DAAP which is currently really broken.

I tested this things on my Gentoo stable machine with Django 1.1.1 and Firefox 3.5
CHROMIUM IS CURRENTLY BROKEN CONCERNING THE <audio> TAG!

TODO:
* Add Playlist features: save, open, rename, delete
* Support drag and drop for the playlist
* Develop a webserver for IP Registration and friends management where you can
  set who can access your music
* Add a friends search where you can search music from your friends shares
* Design improvements (logo)
* Get Chromium to work


Dependencies:

[UBUNTU]
sudo apt-get install python-lxml python-django python-mutagen apache2 sqlite3 libapache2-mod-wsgi python-pysqlite
[GENTOO]
emerge -av dev-python/django dev-python/lxml media-libs/mutagen dev-python/pysqlite dev-db/sqlite www-apache/mod_wsgi www-servers/apache


To get it running install laudio into /opt/laudio then run the following command:
sudo chmod -R a+rwx /opt/laudio

Now put laudio.conf into
/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/

and finally restart the server: 
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

if you run a gentoo machine you want apache to start at startup:
rc-update add apache2 default

Laudio should be accessible in your Browser under http://localhost/laudio

before you scan your music directory make sure its available for read:
chmod -R a+r /home/user/yourmusicdirectory
